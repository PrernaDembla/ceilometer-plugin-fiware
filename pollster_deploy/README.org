* Pollster deploy
  This folder contains a collection of Ansible recipes to automatically install FIWARE pollsters in a FIWARE region.

  This recipes replaces only the installation steps for the pollsters, therefore the second part of the installation (related to Monasca agent) must be done manually following the main [[file:../README.md][README]].

  It is possible to choose the pollster version specifying the desired branch to pull from GitHub.
* How to
** Customize inventory file
   Customize properly the file =hosts= including the IPs and eventually other information related to all compute and controller hosts in the corresponding section.
** Region pollster
   Open the Ansible recipe =region-install.yml= and customize the variables at the very beginning in the =vars= block reflecting your region configurations:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   vars:
    netlist: net04_ext,net05_ext
    latitude: 1.1
    longitude: 12.2
    location: IT
    ram_allocation_ratio: 1.5
    cpu_allocation_ratio: 16
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Install in OpenStack Newton with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ansible-playbook -e "branch=newton" -i hosts --limit=controller pollster_deploy/region-install.yml
   #+END_SRC

** Host pollster
   Install in OpenStack Newton with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ansible-playbook -e "branch=newton" -i hosts --limit=compute pollster_deploy/host-install.yml
   #+END_SRC
